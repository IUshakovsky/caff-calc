One of the most common questions we receive is: "Does coffee or tea have more caffeine?" The answer isn't as straightforward as you might think!

## The Quick Answer

Generally speaking, **coffee contains more caffeine than tea**, but the actual amount can vary significantly based on several factors.

### Average Caffeine Content

**Coffee (8 oz / 240ml):**
- Brewed coffee: 95-200mg
- Espresso (1 oz): 63-75mg
- Instant coffee: 30-90mg
- Decaf coffee: 2-5mg

**Tea (8 oz / 240ml):**
- Black tea: 25-48mg
- Green tea: 25-29mg
- White tea: 15-20mg
- Oolong tea: 30-40mg
- Herbal tea: 0mg (naturally caffeine-free)

## What Affects Caffeine Levels?

### 1. **Brewing Time**
The longer you steep tea or brew coffee, the more caffeine is extracted. A quick 2-minute steep will yield less caffeine than a 5-minute steep.

### 2. **Water Temperature**
Hotter water extracts caffeine more efficiently. Coffee is typically brewed at 195-205°F (90-96°C), while tea varies by type.

### 3. **Coffee Bean/Tea Leaf Type**
- Robusta coffee beans contain almost twice the caffeine of Arabica beans
- Younger tea leaves (like those used in matcha) contain more caffeine than older leaves

### 4. **Grind Size (for coffee)**
Finer grinds expose more surface area, leading to higher caffeine extraction.

## The Surprising Truth About Tea

While tea leaves actually contain **more caffeine by weight** than coffee beans, the way we brew tea results in lower caffeine content per cup:

- Tea leaves: ~3.5% caffeine by weight
- Coffee beans: ~1.5% caffeine by weight

However, we typically use more coffee grounds (10-15g) than tea leaves (2-3g) per cup, and coffee is brewed at higher temperatures for longer periods.

## Health Considerations

Both coffee and tea offer unique health benefits beyond just caffeine:

### Coffee Benefits:
- High in antioxidants
- May reduce risk of type 2 diabetes
- Contains beneficial compounds like chlorogenic acid

### Tea Benefits:
- Contains L-theanine (promotes calm focus)
- Rich in polyphenols
- May support heart health
- Lower acidity than coffee

## Making the Right Choice

- **Time of day** - Tea's lower caffeine makes it better for afternoon/evening
- **Desired effects** - Coffee for strong stimulation, tea for gentle alertness
- **Health goals** - Both offer unique benefits

## Conclusion

Neither coffee nor tea is objectively "better" - it's about finding what works for your body and lifestyle. Use our caffeine calculator to track your intake from all sources and stay within safe limits!
